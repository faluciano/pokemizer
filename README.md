# Pokemizer
This project is a pokemon team randomizer using a specific set of rules.

You can choose a generation and get 30 tries to complete a team.

The rules are as follows:

1. A random starter is given for that generation
2. A screen with 5 cards is displays all with questino marks.
3. You select a card and see what pokemon you received.
4. You automatically keep the pokemon if no other pokemon shares a type with it.
5. You can either replace a pokemon that shares a type with the new pokemon or choose to keep both pokemon.
6. Starters can't be replaced
7. A repeat counts as a failed attempt
8. If a team is full and a pokemon with no common type is selected, it is a failed attempt.
